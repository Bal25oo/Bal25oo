### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Hello, my name is Vicente ChÃ¡vez, a full stack java developer. From Venezuela I brought with me a taste for technology. There I studied Civil Engineering and here I was able to continue learning and growing professionally, this time as a programmer. The combination of both disciplines have enriched my approach in project management, analysis and problem solving. I am a proactive, curious professional, with excellent innovative ideas and the assertive communication to share them. I am eager to discover and learn more and more.
